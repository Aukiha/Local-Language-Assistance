# Local-Language-Assistance
SMS service to help you communicate in unfamiliar languages

**Local Language Assistance (LLA for short)** allows for people seeking help with the local language to be able to ask simple questions such as how to order a coffee at Tim Horton's and get fast responses from people fluent in the language.

**LLA** is built in Java and the Spark framework, using Twilio as the service that handlers the text messages. The app uses a database in order to keep track of the messages and forward the questions and answers to the appropriate people. All of this runs on a DigitalOcean virtual server.
